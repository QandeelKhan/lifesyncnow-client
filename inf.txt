Type the following command to set your username in Git:

python

git config --global user.name "Your_Username"

Type the following command to set your email in Git:

python

git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"

To verify the configuration, type:

lua

git config --global user.name

and

lua

    git config --global user.email

This sets up Git to use the same username and email for all your projects. You can change the configuration for a specific project by using the git config command without the --global flag.

Yes, you can store your GitHub username and personal access token as environment variables in your system, and then reference them in your commands. This way, you don't have to type your credentials every time you want to use the GitHub API.

Here's an example using cURL:

    First, you'll need to generate a personal access token from the GitHub Developer Settings.

    Then, add the following lines to your shell profile file (e.g. ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc) and replace <username> with your GitHub username and <token> with your personal access token:

javascript

export GH_USERNAME=<username>
export GH_TOKEN=<token>

    Restart your terminal or run the following command to reload your profile:

bash

source ~/.bashrc

    Now, you can create a repository by running the following command, replacing <repo_name> with the name of your repository:

bash cmd to create a repository on github

curl -u $GH_USERNAME:$GH_TOKEN https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"<repo_name>"}'

This will use the environment variables to access your GitHub credentials, so you don't have to type them every time.
# ---------To push changes from the main branch to the backup branch, 
you need to checkout the backup branch and merge the changes from the main branch into it. 
Here's the steps to do that in the terminal:

    Checkout the main branch: git checkout main
    Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository: git fetch
    Merge the changes from the main branch into the backup branch: git checkout backup-branch && git merge main
    Push the changes to the remote repository: git push

Note: Replace main and backup-branch with the actual names of your branches.

our application is single, not the cluster based becuase we needed to use kubernettes and docker-swarm for that, which i have no knowledge for them.
digitalocean token for life-sync-now: dop_v1_dd66186ffe4d81e9e70f315f78ce677a59c0879c8bce4126f546ede24ae914e8

❯ docker-machine create(rather then "create" we can use "rm --f life-sync-now-server" to remove this machine) \
        --driver digitalocean \
        --digitalocean-access-token dop_v1_dd66186ffe4d81e9e70f315f78ce677a59c0879c8bce4126f546ede24ae914e8 \

        --digitalocean-image ubuntu-22-10-x64 \
        life-sync-now-server(as a server name, we can call it whatever);
after that we can see a droplet created with the name of life-sync-now-server, a droplet on digitalocean means a server.
To see how to connect your Docker Client to the Docker Engine running on this virtual machine, 
run: docker-machine env life-sync-now-server
cmd:"docker-machine ls" (to see the available created machines names and ip info on our computer)
as now we can access the machine ip we can use ssh(secure shell(a protocol to connect with servers)) to connect with our server by opening a secure shell.
the beauty of docker machine is that we donot have to create the ssh manually and hide all of that complexity of creating and ssh.
cmd: "docker-machine ssh life-sync-now-server" (so we can simply type this followed to logged-in(connect) to to our machine using ssh, and all of this was setup when we created this docker machine(great job), after loging in into ssh we can type "cd /" and press ls to see all the directories of our ubuntu os)
to run the production compose file: 
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build
after doing all the shit mentioned we finally have to run "docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d"
this will gona build our image on the server we created earlier with the docker-machine.
"docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --biuld"

"docker-machine regenerate-certs life-sync-now-server"(sometime require for docker-machine whille deploying because of not connecting to the server, so then aga)
